Repository where this bug witness patch is developed:
https://github.com/wasowski/geometry2_167

The idea: start the node with wrong and good parameters in
parallel with a dummy test that always passes. Then the success of
the rostest only depends on whether the nodes have crashed or not.
Use launch-prefix to inspect whether a node test because of
(expected) parameter validation, or because an assertion failed.

The assertions are inserted by redefining ROS_FATAL for the file
in question (otherwise we would need to change the file, and the
fixing commit would either not pass the test, or would not apply).
