The problem with using static_transform_publisher
(static_transform_broadcaster_program.cpp) directly as a test node is that it
affects the number of parameters that are added to the test node.  The last
parameter is provided for gtest, and this changes the behavior of the code
being tested (the number of parameters passed to main are key in this case).

This is why we created a dummy test node, and run the publisher as a supporting
node.  This way the static_transform_publisher is run like in a normal release
launch.  The existance of a (dummy) test allows to run this launch file as
rostest. Otherwise rostest finds not tests, and reports no failure in
static_transform_publisher. It seems it does not even start it.

Still, even in this case there are some renaming parameters appended and
argv[argc] at the point of assertion is not null (likely because argc has been
decremented during ROS::init).

The bug description is clearly wrong: there is no crash. Just a wrong error
message, because printf no longer crashes on "(null)" -- technically this leads
to undefined behaviour, but modern implementations play safe, and check for NULL.
